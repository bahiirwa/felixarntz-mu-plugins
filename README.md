# Felix Arntz MU Plugins

My collection of MU plugins in individual files within a subdirectory.

## Usage

You can either put the `felixarntz-mu-plugins` directory as well as the `felixarntz-mu-plugins.php` file into your `wp-content/mu-plugins` folder, or you could put all PHP files from the `felixarntz-mu-plugins` directory directly into your `wp-content/mu-plugins` folder.

All files are standalone, so feel free to pick and choose only those you need.
