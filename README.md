# Felix Arntz MU Plugins

My collection of MU plugins in individual files within a subdirectory.

## Usage

You can either put the `felixarntz-mu-plugins` directory as well as the `felixarntz-mu-plugins.php` file into your `wp-content/mu-plugins` folder, or you could put all PHP files from the `felixarntz-mu-plugins` directory directly into your `wp-content/mu-plugins` folder.

All files are standalone, so feel free to pick and choose only those you need.

For maximum flexibility and ease of use, it is recommended that you use the first approach, including the `felixarntz-mu-plugins.php` file. This allows you to define an allowlist of which files should be loaded and to outline further configuration parameters for the individual files included.
